"I mention my job in these blog posts not to brag, but because it helped me learned techniques for problem solving. I won't try and throw out some arbitrary percentage, but problem solving is extremely critical when it comes to programming. This is part of the reason I enjoy programming is because I have found that I enjoy problem solving(when I know enough about something to fix it). Of course this skill transcends programming, but this is a programming blog so that's why we are focusing on problem solving in programming terms. When it comes to having to problem solving in programming, we've all been there. We planned out what we were going to write, wrote our code, and meticulously checked it before actually running it. We feel pretty good about it and suddenly, 47 ERRORS! Or maybe not that many, but still what we think is perfect and should work, doesn't and it's frustrating. You start to question everything, you start to question life. You are banging your head against the wall when the solutions you are trying do not work. I've been here, not just with programming, but with my job, and I have found some tips and tricks that will help you become better at problem solving."

## Don't get overwhelmed
"This seems like a no-brainer tip and I'm probably not telling you anything revolutionary, but it is crucial that no matter how big of a project you are working on and how many errors you get, BREATHE! The right mental approach towards fixing the problem will make a HUGE difference. Even if it is a problem that is an easy fix, I make the habit to stop and take a deep breath beforehand, because sometimes fixing one problem can reveal 15 other problems. I've also had cases where I had 8 problems and fixing one problem fixed all of them. Just breathe and don't let it intimidtate you. One major way to do this is by..."

## Focusing on one error at a time
"In the hypothetical case of 47 errors, you don't want to try and fix all of them at once. Sometimes multiple errors are tied into one problem. In the case of the tic tac toe game I built, with how many methods were being built, if one of the methods was messed up, then all of the methods relying on that one method will fail as well. Even if this is not the case, it is imperative that all of your attention is focused on one issue. Even if you just go through and pick out all of the smaller errors(such as missing semicolons or other syntax errors). Don't bite off more than you can chew."

## Save backups frequently
"A lot of times I will go down a road trying to solve a problem and in the end my code looks completely different. Even if clicking undo repeatedly is an option, it's still not as good as just going to a functional backup. This will prevent you from having to cpmpletely retrace your steps and you can just plop right back to where you want to be."

## Find something that works and compare
"It's unlikely that you will find a program that is exactly what you are trying to write. Because if you were(there may not be too much of a point in writing it as opposed to copying and pasting). But you can find similar things and make necessary changes. If a section of code is extremely broken, then sometimes the best thing to do is use another code that works. I've done this a lot with my own code, but just changes variables and arguments accordingly."

## Run your code piece by piece
"Sometimes, just testing your code in sections, such as methods in Ruby, will help to identify problems you wouldn't have otherwise found. This also helps you to better understand how your program is flowing since you can see problems arise when something new is introduced into the program. This also helps you because you can even further isolate what the problem is. You know that everything you have written so far has worked. Sometimes its better to just write and test certain parts of your code even on smaller projects."

"Even if these may seem like simple tips, just consciously practicing these tips will really help you in getting faster and better at problem solving."
