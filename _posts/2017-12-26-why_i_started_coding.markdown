# "When I started college, I began as a Business major and then switched to Psychology. After taking a math class and oddly enough enjoying it, I switched to Engineering. During my college stint in this major, I came across several programming classes and throughly enjoyed them. I still cannot remember my reason for not pursuing it further. After a year and a half in my current job(at the time of this blog), I realized I didn't want to travel for the rest of my life and I wasn't happy. I searched for other work, but I found nothing for which I was qualified that paid well. I knew that I needed a more marketable talent."

# "On facebook, I saw an advertisement for Flatiron School's free bootcamp prep. I looked more into Flatiron and saw the job placement rate and the salary for programming jobs. My eyes lit up and I signed up for the bootcamp prep. I absolutely loved it. As I programmed and problem solved, I just felt like it was my calling. Previously, I had no motivation to do anything, but suddenly, I wanted to program. It even started improving other areas of my life. I started waking up earlier, I found myself being more productive(in general), and I pushed through to solve problems that I would have previously given up on. I also enjoyed the benefits of having this skill/craft."

# "To me, programming is more than just a potential career, it is a craft; it is an ability. It is something that you can continue to improve. You can always learn new techniques, you can take on new challenges, and learn new programming languages. The idea of being called a programmer was something that excited me. I decided that if I was going to do this, I was going all in. I purchased a mac computer when my existing Windows PC would not cooperate. I even decided that I would name my dog Ruby. I not only saw a career, I saw an opportunity to create; I saw an opportunity to do something that I never knew I loved. I also saw an opportunity to become a part of a community. My only regret is that I didn't start earlier."
