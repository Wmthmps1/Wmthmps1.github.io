"Like every student, I started the course learning Ruby. I worked my way through the Tic-Tac-Toe course and managed to slog through it. I like it, but I struggled with it more than I thought I would. I started the HTML and CSS section and it seemed confusing. The header, body, paragraph thing was pretty self-explanatory. Then you get into attributes, descendants, parents, childrens, and siblings. My head started spinning and I had to get some water and lie down. I still can't fully explain all of these realtionships and I believe that a better understanding will come with time, but I understand it enough now thanks to the Graffiti Lab. This, along with building the websites(even though they were code-alongs) really got me pumped and I have never been more excited to boot up learn.co and jump into the course. Ruby was fun, don't get me wrong, but it's something about being able to immediately see your work come to life(at least with learn ide). Now I can look at websites and understand how they are laid out, I can see the coding and what CSS code they needed in order to make that work. I did a little CSS/HTML in the bootcamp prep, but I have a greater understanding now of the relationship between the two. "

"I won't make any rash career decisions until I have checked out all of the programming languages, but this certainly seems like a great side job to bring in some extra cash and work from home. While there are some things that I still have yet to learn(such as how other programming languages interact with them), I know that it is something I would enjoy and I believe I may have found my favorite code, but it's a little too early to tell."
