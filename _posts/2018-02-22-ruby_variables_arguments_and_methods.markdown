"To many, programming of any sort is something completely foreign. I guess you could say that it's a... different language(pun intended). While there are a lot of languages to dive into, I'm going to focus today on Ruby(after all that will be the name of my dog). Even though the focus of this blog is on Ruby, variables are universal across a lot of programming languages. It is also used in math in a much similar way. But much like programming, math can be confusing to most so I will use a more practical example."

"If you are reading this blog, I would very much assume that you are human. So think of yourself(a person) as an assigned value(I'll explain shortly). When a mom first finds out she's pregnant, she doesn't know whether the baby will be a boy or a girl and in probably most cases what the baby's name will be. That baby is the variable. Let's say that baby turns out to be a boy named Steve. Now our baby has a value of Steve. Now when the parent talks about their baby, they will be referring to Steve. Let's say Steve is a couple of years old and the parents have another baby and this one is a girl and let's call her Sharon. Now when they refer to the baby, they are talking about Sharon and no longer are they talking about Steve.

Now let's say Steve is now 18 and is looking for a job. There is a local restaraunt looking for a dishwasher and he decides to fill that role. The restaurant, to succeed, has to have three major functions: cook, clean, and serve. Think of these three things as methods that require the "Restaurant" program to function. In order to properly clean, a dishwasher is required. You can think of the dishwasher as the variable. The restaurant has a vacancy in the dishwasher position. If Steve applied and got the job, Steve would be "passed" into that variable role as an argument the same way that a Karen or Dave could after Steve moved on from that job.
